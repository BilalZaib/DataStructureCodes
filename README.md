# DataStructureCodes
All Data Structures that were taught in data structure course are implemented by myself.

This repository contains basic data structure implementation in C++.
Data Structures:
  - Simple Arrays
  - Circular Array
  - Link List
  - Circular Link List
  - Doubly Link List
  - Circular Doubly Link List
  - Stack
  - LIFO Queue
  - FIFO Queue
  - Heap
  - AVL Tree
  - Hash Table
  - Binary Search Tree
  - Graph

All data structures handled with pointers except Simple Array.
Some Data structure implemented with different variations.
